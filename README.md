## Commit 1 Reflection notes
In this commit, I dove into building a simple, single-threaded web server in Rust. I set up a TcpListener on 127.0.0.1:7878 to accept connections from my browser, and used a BufReader to process each HTTP request line by line until I reached the end of the header section. This hands-on experience not only gave me a clearer picture of how HTTP requests work but also highlighted Rustâ€™s powerful network programming capabilities. Even though I used unwrap() for simplicity, it was a great reminder of the importance of proper error handling, which I plan to refine later. Overall, this project has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'm excited to explore further improvements like better response handling and concurrency in the future.

In this commit, I took a significant step forward by updating my Rust web server to serve a proper HTML page. I learned that returning a web page involves more than just sending raw data; it requires crafting a well-formed HTTP response that includes essential headers like "Content-Length" so that the browser knows how much data to expect. Reading the HTML file from disk, calculating its length, and formatting the response correctly with CRLF line breaks deepened my understanding of HTTP protocols and the inner workings of a web server. This hands-on experience has not only boosted my confidence in handling file I/O and string manipulation in Rust, but also highlighted the importance of following protocol standards to ensure seamless communication between the server and the browser.
